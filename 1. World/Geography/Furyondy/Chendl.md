## Overview
**Chendl** is the royal capital of the [[Kingdom of Furyondy]], built as a planned “ideal city” and famed for elegance: **strong walls**, **wide canals**, **hanging gardens**, **broad boulevards**, **sculpture**, and **public parks**.   
It sits at the heart of the tiny but lavishly cultivated **Fairwain Province** (about **30 square miles**), landscaped with exotic flora gathered from across Oerik.

**Population:** ~**15,600** (deliberately capped; immigration monitored).
**Tone:** urbane, lawful, expensive, politically dense.

## City Character
### A planned city (no slums)
Chendl was laid out by master architects, designed to be a capital worthy of “Old Ferrond.” Even after the siege years, it has **no slums** and little “recognizable lower-class housing.” 

### Cost of living
A traveler should expect **50–100 gp/month** as a baseline to stay in the city; “anyone who can pay for lodging” can visit, but citizenship requires proof of **“verifiable worth”** (skills/capital to start a business).

## Landmarks & Notable Places (Canonical)
### The Royal Palace & Floating Garden
- The **Royal Palace** is gold-veined white marble with a gleaming transparent dome filled with exotic plants and birds.   
- Above it floats the King’s “magnificent magical garden,” reached by **two delicate white-arched bridges** guarded by House Regiment officers.   
- A **temple to [[Heironeous]]** stands on the palace grounds. 

### Boulevards & lighting
Continual-flame lanterns line major boulevards, reinforcing the sense that the city is always on display. 

### The Wyrm (Inn)
“The best inn in Chendl, and probably in all of Furyondy,” with prices commonly **4×** the usual rates.

### The Weatherhaven Inn (near the barracks)
A military-favored hangout; it gouges prices—**double** for those displaying rank, **triple** for everyone else.

---

## Government, Power, and Politics
### The Crown
Chendl is ruled directly by [[King Belvor IV]] from the Royal Palace. 

### The Knightly Conclave
The **[[Knightly Conclave]]** meets in Chendl: nobles and knights debate issues and offer advice; it’s influential but not supreme—Belvor values support, yet limits their power. 
(Closely tied to the [[Knights of the Hart]] / “Knights of Furyondy.”)

---

## Law & Security
Chendl is strongly **Lawful Good**, with a well-trained **police force** and heavy military presence. 

### Garrison & commanders
- **Garrison strength:** ~**850** (including some soldiers from Kalinstren and the King’s personal forces), with plans to increase.
- Three trusted commanders reside within the King’s complex: **Generals Gallantren, Bemedior, and Yemanien**.  
- Heavily armed non-military visitors are **noticed and watched**.

---

## Faith in Chendl
- **Heironeous** is the major faith; **High Cleric [[Garaeth Heldenster]]** is a major ally of the King. 
- Among non-nobles, **St. Cuthbert** is especially favored; **Overseer Redankin Desmart** supports the King’s policies.  
- Other notable faiths include **Rao**, **Trithereon**, and **Delleb**. 
- Major temples in the city include (at least): Heironeous, Pholtus, Pelor, Istus, Rao, Delleb, St. Cuthbert, Kord, Allitur, Trithereon.

## Society & Entertainment
Chendl is a place to **wine and dine**, stroll scented gardens, attend **opera**, and gamble in **regulated casinos** (generally safe and mostly honest; high-stakes gambling is restricted by royal regulation).

Social caste matters; locals track who’s “old blood,” knighted, artisan-elite, or merely “everyone else.”

---

## The Underbelly (Small, but sharp)
Chendl’s Thieves’ Guild struggles due to militia and soldiers, but “secret clubs” outside the city cater to high rollers, narcotics, and vice—widely “known secrets,” allegedly run by thieves/assassins, with worse odds than legal casinos. 

---

## Recent History (Canonical Baseline)
- **583 CY:** During an orcish siege, the city wall and even the King’s palace suffered significant structural damage.   
- Post-wars: Most damage has been repaired; lingering scars remain mainly in the Fairwain countryside. Belvor plans **magical defenses** to prevent another siege.   
- Political strain: Rumors claim Belvor ceded much of the Fairwain’s hereditary royal land to Viscount Derwent to secure crusade support—officially denied.
