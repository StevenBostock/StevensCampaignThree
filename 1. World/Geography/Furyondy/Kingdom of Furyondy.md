## Geography
Furyondy spans the western half of the Flanaess’ northwestern heartlands, bounded by **Nyr Dyv** to the east, the **Velverdyva River** to the south and west, and reaching north toward the **Vesve Forest** and **Whyestil Lake**.

### Climate
The **two great lakes** strongly moderate weather; the north is wetter, snowfall is common (heavier in the north), but temperatures are “not overly harsh.”

---

## People & Culture
Furyondy is **lawful, established, and ethnocentric**—war has left many common folk openly hostile to humanoids/“monstrous” ancestry (including **half-orcs**), while **elves of the Vesve/Highfolk** are treated as mysterious exceptions. 

---

## Government & Power
### The Crown and the Council
Belvor’s kingship is **hereditary** but constrained by the **Noble Council** (provincial representatives) whose support matters for major decrees—often putting provincial interests above the kingdom’s good.

### Key Court Powers (Chendl)
- **Belvor IV:** veteran warrior-king devoted to **Heironeous**; politically sharp; enjoys hunting/jousting; unmarried; **Prince Thrommel** officially declared dead.
- **The Chamber of Four:** Belvor’s wizard advisors in the palace, focused on magical defense of the realm.
- **Garaeth Heldenster:** high cleric of **Heironeous**, deeply loyal to Belvor and the people.
- **General Staff:** senior commanders in Chendl advise contrasting strategies (offense vs defense). 

---

## Faith
Traditionally not deeply pious, Furyondy’s churches gained prestige after the wars. Major currents include:
- **Old Faith (Obad-Hai):** historically popular among farmers/rangers/druids; centered in the **Gleaming Glades** (Gold County), but declining since the Greyhawk Wars. 
- **Boccob:** arcane worship centered at **Pantarn** (Littleberg), growing since the wars.  
- (By province, defensive/martial faiths like **Heironeous**, **St. Cuthbert**, **Mayaheine** are especially prominent.)

---

## Role of Magic
There is **little organized arcane infrastructure**: no true wizard guild; the monastery of **Boccob in Pantarn** is the main arcane nexus outside the King’s own advisors. Common folk are “at ease” with wizardry after the war years, but still cautious—**Wee Jas** adherents are often distrusted; **sorcerers** can face colder receptions as “uncontrolled” magic. 

---

## Law & Custom (Important for Campaign Play)
Furyondy law is divided into **civil** vs **criminal**, with cleric magistrates and (for severe matters) judge panels. Nobles may settle civil disputes via **non-lethal duels** (Belvor’s wartime decree).

### “The Dead Shall Not Rule”
A long-standing royal edict (King Arvas II) states that a dead lord’s titles pass to next of kin **even if the lord is raised**—an explosive legal landmine for succession politics. 

---

## Military & Notable Groups
### Knights of the Hart — Furyondian Branch (“Knights of Furyondy”)
A prestigious knightly order active on the northern front and in politics (via the **Knightly Conclave** in Chendl). They maintain strongholds, scout Iuz’s borders, and push policy; **Castle Hart** serves as a major base.

### Mail Riders of Furyondy
A small civil service corps (~100) delivering royal mail across settlements.

### Greenjerkin Rangers
A ranger militia known for diplomacy and practical problem-solving; current political momentum favors **expanding** them to patrol roads/heartlands and act as anti-spy eyes for Belvor.

## Player-Facing Snapshot
Furyondy is a proud, lawful kingdom rebuilding from war. Its capital, **Chendl**, is the seat of **King Belvor IV**, a famed war-king. The realm’s greatest enemy is **Iuz**, and much of Furyondy’s identity is bound up in holding the line—through knights, soldiers, and the hard work of common folk.
