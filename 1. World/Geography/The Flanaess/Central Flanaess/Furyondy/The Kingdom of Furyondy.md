# Description
Furyondy is one of oldest and most noble Kingdoms on Oerth. This nation forms the backbone for the forces of good in the lands and is the stalwart enemy of Luz the Evil. The nation is battle weary and is slowly recovering from the ravages of two great wars. Many of it's once great roads and castles are badly damaged, and the royal coffers are nearly empty from the war effort. Noble King Belvor IV rules the land, however seven noble houses also hold considerable power in the realm. The people of Furyondy are strong and they continue to rebuild their cities and towns, knowing that the battle with the great evil is far from over.

Furyondy stretches across the western half of the Flanaess, from the Nyr Dyv in the east, the mighty Velverdyva River in the south and west, north to the Vesve Forest and the shores of Whyestil lake. The kingdom is broken into smaller provinces, each ruled by a noble house. These include the County of Crystalreach, the Barony of Kalinstren, the Viscounty of the March, the barony of Littleberg, the Gold County, the Duchy of the Reach, and the Barony of Willip.
