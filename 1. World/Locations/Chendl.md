<font color="#7f7f7f">**Chendl** is the **royal capital of Furyondy**—a bright, disciplined court-city where **law, chivalry, and wartime logistics** sit shoulder-to-shoulder with merchant ambition. It’s the realm’s **political heart** (royal court, noble power-brokers, and high clergy), its **strategic nerve center** for the northern border wars, and a magnet for **petitioners, knights, spies, and would-be heroes**. In **591 CY**, with **[[Prince Thrommel IV]] declared dead**, Chendl’s public pageantry (oaths, funerary honors, proclamations, and the coming **grand tournament**) masks a city on a knife-edge—**grief weaponized into propaganda**, succession anxiety simmering beneath ceremony, and every faction hunting leverage in the capital’s crowded streets and marble halls.</font>

## Description
<font color="#7f7f7f">The royal capital of Chendl is located at the center of Fairwain, and is the true gem of the province. Chendl is a most magnificent city, designed from the ground up with architectural elegance and precision; and now, some years after the Wars and siege that decimated the city, that elegance is returning. Chendl is strongly walled and has wide canals, hanging gardens, broad boulevards, elegant sculptures and ample public parks. Continual flame lanterns shine brightly along the boulevards and the Kings magnificent magical garden floats some 300ft above the royal palace. Access to the Kings garden is by two bridges of delicate white arches. These bridges guarded by some of the Kings own House Regiment officers. Atop the magical garden at the highest point is a flagpole that flies the Kings personal standard. The palace is a majestic building of gold-veined white marble with a central gleaming transparent dome filled with exotic plants and birds. The palace grounds hold a temple to [[Heironeous]] the god of valor.
Chendl was laid out by master architects and extensively planned. Even after the siege years, there are no slums, nor any recognisable lower class social housing.
The citizens of Chendl are very law-abiding. A well trained police force patrols the city. Chendl is a place to wine and dine, sniff the exotic gardens, see the opera and gamble at casinos and gaming houses. All casinos are safe to visit and mostly honest. Royal regulations forbid high-stakes gambling in most locations, but there plenty of outrageously overpriced restaurants and expensive taverns to spend your gold in. Chendl's social castes are always a concern to the locals. The "old blood" nobility and the [[Noble Council]] are at the top of the list. Knights and lesser nobles second, skilled artisans and the richest merchants third, other artisans and merchants next, others last.
Chendl has a sordid side, but it's not very large. The Thieves Guild is struggling due to large numbers of militia and military within the city. In the outside the city there are numerous high-stakes gambling dens run by the Thieves and Assassin Guilds.
[[Heironeous]] is the major faith in Chendl and High Cleric [[Garaeth Heldenster]] is a major ally of the king. Those outside the noble class tend to favour [[St Cuthbert]] and that church's leader, Overseer [[Redankin Desmart]], supports the kings policies. Other notable religions include [[Rao]], [[Trithereon]] and [[Delleb]] the old Oeridian god of learning and intellect.
Chendl has a garrison strength of 850 soliders, including soliders of [[Kalinstren]] and the Kings own regiment. Three trusted military commanders - Generals [[Gallantren]], [[Bemedior]] and [[Yemanien]] - stay within the Kings complex and command the troops in Chendl.</font>

## Notable
### Figures
- <font color="#7f7f7f">[[Belvor IV]]</font>, _King of Furyondy_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">King Belvor is in his sixties, stands over six feet tall, and is strong and regal in appearance. He has short, light brown hair, blue-green eyes, and a prominent jaw line. The King may be a bitter-hearted old warrior, but he remains devoted to the teachings of [[Heironeous]], the god of valor. Belvor is known as a wise and cunning King and many fear political dealings with him despite the rumors that Belvor only goes through the motions of leadership. He enjoys hunting, archery and jousting. He is not married, and there are many rumors of betrothals occurring. He has a single son, the missing-and-declared-dead [[Prince Thrommel]]. </font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Cataryna]] of Trithereon</font>, _Trithereon Cleric_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">This young flame-haired cleric travels throughout the northern provinces visiting the faithful of Trithereon. She aids adventurers striking into the lands of Iuz and often arranges healing and similar magic to those who return alive. Although she is loyal to King Belvor, she has little patience for diplomacy or the doldrums of political maneuvering…</font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Gellain]]</font>, _Velunese Ambassador_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Gellain is a blond-haired, green- eyed, handsome man in his early forties. He is very sociable and well meaning, but something of a bore, especially since he delights in reminding everyone exactly how important Veluna was to Furyondy in the post-war years. Even though Furyondy has stabilized a bit, easing their reliance on [[Veluna]]’s generosity, Gellain enjoys tremendous influence in Belvor’s court.</font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Garaeth Heldenster]]</font>, _High Cleric of Heironeous_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Garaeth is the high cleric to Heironeous in Furyondy. He is nearly as old as the King, but a Wish slowed his natural aging, and he appears to be only 35 or 36. He is 5' 9" tall and very charming and wise. Garaeth is deeply devoted to Belvor, as well as to the citizens of Furyondy, and he will support any of the King’s decisions, and any effort to aid farmers and workers. Several junior clerics and warriors of the faith can almost always be found accompanying Garaeth, as he tends to the affairs of the church in Chendl.</font>

- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Redankin Desmart]]</font>, _Overseer of St Cuthbert_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Unwise is the person who tries to cross Overseer Desmart. This vigilant, devoted man truly represents the more retributive side of St. Cuthbert of the Cudgel. He is red-faced and overweight, and nearly fifty, and is blunt and impersonal. The charges of St. Cuthbert are foremost in his mind at all times, and any advice he offers the King will be to the best benefit of “Cuthbert’s Lot.” He is the leader of St. Cuthbert’s Order of Billets in Furyondy. He calls for taxation of the rich and defense of the poor.</font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Vendenn]]</font>, _Canon of Rao_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Vendenn is a reasonable and pleasant man. He is tall (6' 1"), handsome with his gray hair and eyes, and in decent shape. He is a charming and cultured man.</font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">General [[Gallantren]]</font>, _Military Advisor_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Gallantren is the most senior of the three military commanders in Chendl, and one of the closest of Belvor’s military advisors. He is tall and well-muscled, with long, dark hair and deep-set eyes. He is in his early forties.</font>
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">General [[Bemedior]]</font>, _Military Advisor_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Bemedior is the most vocal of the three military commanders in Chendl. He is sympathetic to the church of Trithereon, and so urges more offensive action against Iuz. Bemedior is broad-chested man in his late thirties with a thick moustache; his brown hair is balding on top.</font> 
	  
- <font color="7f7f7f">General [[Yemanien]]</font>, _Military Advisor_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Yemanien is the most cautious of the three military commanders in Chendl, pushing for a defensive front against Iuz, as opposed to more offensive military action. Yemanien is a fair-haired, charismatic man in his early thirties.</font> 

- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Sir Lanistor]]</font>, _Dean of College of War_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">The current head dean of the College of War is Sir Lanistor, a [[Knight of the Hart]]. Fiercely loyal, he is a militant man who drives his students with visions of conquest to drive back our old enemy. He has been at the college for four years via royal appointment.</font> 

- <font color="7f7f7f">[[Sir Quill Kith'Barden]]</font>, Greenjerkin Ranger_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Quill is a Knight of Furyondy, a member of the Knightly Conclave, and a respected member of the [[Greenjerkin Rangers]]. He has blond hair, green eyes, and a well-trimmed beard. Quill stands over six feet tall and is fond of wearing woodland colors. His human parents were slain by orcs and surrogate elven parents raised him. Quill excels at archery and his favorite bow, Tormentor, is a composite longbow. In sessions at the Knightly Conclave, Quill has been calling for an expansion of the Greenjerkin Rangers to help patrol the roads of Furyondy.</font> 

### Factions
- <font color="#7f7f7f">[[Chamber of Four]]</font>, _Royal Advisors_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">The Four are Belvor’s personal wizard advisors, who reside inside his Royal Palace. They consist of [[Karzalin]], master elementalist of fire; [[Gorn Gydresol]], newly appointed air elementalist; [[Pisenten]], resident water elementalist; and [[Dramaynen]], earth elementalist and sage, and a follower of [[Ulaa]]. These wizards are all loyal to Belvor, and all, with the exception of Gorn, seasoned in battle. All four advise Belvor on all matters magical in the defense of Furyondy. As a group they tend to be rather antisocial.</font>

- <font color="#7f7f7f">[[Noble Council]]</font>, _Royal Advisors_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">The seven provincial lords of Furyondy have representatives in Chendl known as the Noble Council. The King must gain the support of this group before making important decrees of law and country. Each representative typically holds his or her own political interests above that of the Kingdom. The current Noble Council members include [[Sir Radiur Nelonshir]] of [[Kalinstren]], [[Baroness Scheredenn]] of [[Littleberg]], [[Toj Remarukus]] of [[Willip]], [[Cleric Jalquayne]] of [[Crystalreach]], [[Gilbair le Ronde]] of the [[Reach]], [[Carter de Gurwaltt]] of the [[Gold County]], and [[Telemmand]] of the [[March]].</font>

- <font color="#7f7f7f">[[Knights Conclave]]</font>, _Royal Advisors_
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">A group of minor nobles, known as the Knightly Conclave, frequently debate issues and offers their advice to the King. While the King relies on their support, they fall well below the Noble Council in both power and influence. The Conclave follows elaborate and ancient traditions of rank and procedures. Their head speaker goes by the formal title "Cerise Pursuivant Dragon." They are always looking for ways to curry favor with Belvor, and perhaps boost their power and influence.</font>

### Locations
- <font color="#7f7f7f">College of War</font>
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Set upon a large hill overlooking the city the white buildings of the Furyondian College of War appear to be more of an estate than a military complex. However, the observant will notice the riding fields, siege engines, and other signs of war craft built for the students. The College of War was founded in 489 CY and has provided many of the highly skilled military commanders of Furyondy since. The top graduates of the college are known as Warmasters.</font>
- <font color="#7f7f7f">Heroes' Rest Inn</font>
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Comparable to the King’s Arms inn in terms of both quality and price, the Heroes’ Rest attracts a slightly less urbane traveler that the Arms. Prices at the Rest are triple the normal rate, but considered "not bad" for Chendl.</font>
	 
- <font color="#7f7f7f">King's Arms Tavern</font>
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">The King’s Arms is a good place for wealthier, more seasoned adventurers to stay the night. The Arms has a large common room available, as well as several private dinner rooms. Prices at the King’s Arms are triple the normal rate, but considered "not bad" for Chendl. </font>
	
- <font color="#7f7f7f">Sutter's</font>
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Sutter’s is an exclusive restaurant that it, for all intents and purposes, a “by invitation only” establishment for anyone without a title or a rich reputation. Sutter’s also houses a small gaming room, where minor nobles spend their nights.</font> 
	
- <font color="#7f7f7f">The Weatherhaven Inn</font>
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Located very near the garrison barracks, and part of the area that services them, the Weatherhaven Inn is a popular hangout for warriors and military men. Prices here are double that of those in the PHB for anyone displaying military rank, and three times the price for anyone else.</font> 
	
- <font color="#7f7f7f">The Wyrm</font> 
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">The Wyrm is the best inn in Chendl, and probably in all of Furyondy. The rooms here are comfortable, the décor fashionable, the food savory. The prices reflect this, commonly four times the normal prices listed in the PHB.</font>
