## Quick ID
**King of Furyondy**, reigning from [[Chendl]] — an aging paladin-king devoted to **Heironeous**.

## Description
In his **sixties**, **tall** and still powerfully built; weathered nobility rather than frailty. Crisp posture, measured gestures. Enjoys **hunting**, **archery**, and **jousting** (and values those skills in others).

## Public Reputation
- **Wise and politically sharp**; many nobles fear bargaining with him.
- Some whisper he “only goes through the motions” at court — interpreted as grief, fatigue, or calculated distance.

## Court Position
Belvor rules amid three major power blocs in [[Chendl]]:
- [[Noble Council]] (provincial leverage and lawmaking consent)
- [[Knightly Conclave]] (lesser nobles seeking prestige and influence)
- [[Chamber of Four]] (arcane advisors responsible for magical defense)

## Family and Succession
Belvor is **unmarried** (persistent rumors of possible alliances). His heir, **Prince Thrommel**, has been **officially declared dead** — a declaration that changes everything.

## Player-Facing Summary
**King Belvor IV** is Furyondy’s aging warrior-king: devout, cautious, and surrounded by competing advisors. With the prince declared dead, every courtly gesture hints at what comes next.
