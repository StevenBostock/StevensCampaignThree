## Quick ID
Belvor’s senior fire-specialist in the [[Chamber of Four]]. The one people whisper about when “accidents” happen.

## Appearance and Manner
Immaculate robes with scorch-silk trim; steady hands; eyes that measure ignition points in every room. Speaks with the patience of someone who can end a conversation in a single syllable.

## Public Face
- “Necessary evils” are still **necessary**.
- Treats civic inconvenience as an acceptable price for survival.

## Private Drive
Prevent another catastrophe in Chendl—at any cost that doesn’t directly threaten the crown.

## Relationships
- [[Belvor IV]]: loyal, protective; expects deference.
- [[Pisenten]]: respects her rigor; clashes over “human cost.”
- [[Dramaynen]]: argues about permanence vs adaptability.
- [[Gorn Gydresol]]: tests him constantly.
