## Overview
The **Chamber of Four** are the King’s **personal wizard-advisors** in [[Chendl]]. They advise on—and execute—matters of **arcane defense** for the capital and, by extension, the realm.

## Known Members (By Elemental Focus)
- **Karzalin** — fire specialist; the most feared in open conflict.
- **Gorn Gydresol** — air specialist; newest appointment; ambitious and eager to prove value.
- **Pisenten** — water specialist; practical, patient, and relentless in analysis.
- **Dramaynen** — earth specialist; a sage devoted to **Ulaa**; favors permanence, warding, and stability.

**Group temperament:** loyal to Belvor, competent, and largely **socially distant**. They prefer solutions over conversation.

## Role in Chendl’s Defense
The Chamber’s priority is preventing another siege-by-magic. Their projects are expensive, secretive, and politically disruptive: rare components, restricted areas, sanctioned searches, and emergency rituals that may require cooperation (or coercion).

## Methods and Assets
- **Authority by proximity:** they speak with the implicit weight of the crown.
- **Ritual infrastructure:** secure chambers, component supply chains, and layered wards.
- **Crisis powers:** during magical emergencies they may push for curfews, quarantines, and citywide restrictions.

## Relationships
- **[[Belvor IV]]:** absolute loyalty; primary patron and shield.
- **[[Noble Council]]:** tension over budgets, oversight, and civil authority.
- **[[Knightly Conclave]]:** mutual irritation; the Conclave wants credit and visibility, the Chamber wants silence and compliance.
- **Temples of Chendl:** pragmatic cooperation when threats escalate.
