## Overview
The **Knightly Conclave** is a bloc of **minor nobles** who debate issues and offer counsel to the crown. They have less authority than the [[Noble Council]], but more *visibility* among tourneys, knighthood, and public honor.

## Culture and Protocol
- The Conclave is wrapped in **ancient ceremony**: titles, precedence, and ritual phrasing matter.
- Their presiding voice bears the formal title **“Cerise Pursuivant Dragon.”**

## Typical Motivation
They seek to **curry favor**, earn prestige, and prove usefulness—especially in matters of defense where glory can be claimed. They are also quick to take offense at being treated as irrelevant.

## Influence and Assets
- **Soft power:** favors, introductions, honors, public praise.
- **Social access:** tournaments, salons, knightly circles.
- **Deniability:** they often operate via intermediaries so failure doesn’t stain the Conclave itself.

## Relationships
- **Belvor IV:** they want to be seen as indispensable.
- **[[Noble Council]]:** rivalry; the Council dismisses them, which the Conclave never forgets.
- **[[Chamber of Four]]:** friction; the Conclave wants recognition, the Chamber wants silence and resources.
