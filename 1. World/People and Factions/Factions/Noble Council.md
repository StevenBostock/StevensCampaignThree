# Noble Council

## Overview
The **Noble Council** is the assembly of **provincial representatives** whose support the crown must secure before issuing major national decrees. They are powerful—and frequently prioritize **provincial advantage** over the good of the realm.

## Composition (Seven Provincial Powers)
Representatives commonly cited in court circles include:
- **Sir Radiur Nelonshir** — Kalinstren  
- **Baroness Scheredenn** — Littleberg  
- **Toj Remarukus** — Willip  
- **Cleric Jalquayne** — Crystalreach  
- **Gilbair le Ronde** — the Reach  
- **Carter de Gurwaltt** — the Gold County  
- **Telemmand** — the March  

(Use these as anchors; swap individuals if you want to reflect deaths, replacements, or faction shifts.)

## Political Behavior
- **Legitimacy as a weapon:** “lawful authority” is their preferred blade—summons, writs, escorts, and procedural traps.
- **Controlled leaks:** they shape public perception through rumor, patronage, and selective scandal.
- **Rivalry pressure:** they resent being bypassed by knightly initiatives or arcane secrecy.

## Influence and Assets
- **Consent leverage:** the crown needs them for large-scale lawmaking and national policy.
- **Provincial networks:** money, courts, soldiers, and family alliances back home.
- **Operatives:** legal agents, retainers, and “questioners” who can harry rivals without drawing a sword.

## Relationships
- **Belvor IV:** mutual dependence—hard bargaining under a veneer of loyalty.
- **[[Knightly Conclave]]:** contemptuous rivalry; they see the Conclave as noisy lesser nobles.
- **[[Chamber of Four]]:** uneasy coexistence over security budgets and emergency powers.
