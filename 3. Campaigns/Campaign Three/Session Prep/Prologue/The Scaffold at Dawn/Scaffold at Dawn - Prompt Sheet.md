# Scaffold at Dawn — Opening Scene (Read-Aloud)

## Establishing Shot: Chendl’s Town Square
**Read aloud:**

Chendl wakes cold and gray, the kind of morning where breath hangs in the air like a held opinion. The town square is already crowded—too crowded for dawn—its cobbles ringed by temporary barricades and watchmen in orderly lines. Banners hang from posts and balconies, bright enough to feel like an argument: *we are strong, we are clean, we are safe.*

A wooden scaffold squats at the square’s center, freshly built, freshly tarred, with a block and a hooded headsman waiting under a canvas awning. Two braziers burn low, their smoke flattening in the damp air. Somewhere close, a bell tolls once—slow, deliberate—then goes quiet.

The people here are a cross-section of the city: merchants wrapped in fine cloaks, laborers with hard hands and harder stares, templefolk with prayer-beads threaded through their fingers. Some are angry. Some are afraid. Many look like they’ve come to be seen coming.

Snatches of talk drift by—careful, excited, hungry:
“Traitor.”  
“They say Iuz has friends even here.”  
“Someone *important*, or they wouldn’t make a show of it.”  
“Hush. The watch is listening.”

And they are. Watch eyes slide over the crowd—not hunting danger, but hunting reactions.

## Spotlight Prompt: The First PC (Half-Elf Bard)
**DM cue (not read-aloud):**
Open the floor to the bard first.

**Ask:**
- “Where are you in the square, and what do you look like as Chendl gathers to witness ‘justice’?”
- “Who are the vulnerable people you’ve been trying to help lately—and what drew you to them?”
- “What’s your *gut reaction* to public executions: disgust, fascination, fear, resignation?”

**Private reminder for you (DM cue):**
The bard’s link to Lysa is real, but **do not mention it yet**. Let the player express values and identity first. The reveal will retroactively snap the connection into focus.

---

## Invite the Other PCs In
**DM cue:**
After the bard, ask each player:
- “Would you be here for this execution? If yes, why?”
- “Describe yourself and where you’re standing.”
- “What rumor or reason brought you out at dawn?”

> If someone says “no,” offer a tether:
> - they’re on duty (watch, temple, courier)
> - they’re escorting someone
> - they were sent to observe “something political”
> - they’re here for work, pickpocketing, or curiosity

## The Speech (Not a Relevant NPC)
**Read aloud:**

A voice rises from the platform—polished, practiced, and loud enough to reach the back rows.

“Citizens of Chendl. Furyondy endures because we do not tolerate rot within our walls. Our enemies wear many faces. They whisper in alleys, they corrupt honest hearts, they bargain with darkness and call it necessity.”

A pause—timed. The speaker lets the crowd’s unease tighten.

“Today, justice is not merely carried out. It is *witnessed.* So that all may know: there is no shelter here for those who serve the Old Enemy.”

## The Reveal: The Condemned is Brought Out (Lysa Corven)
**Read aloud:**

Two watchmen haul the condemned up the steps.

At first you see only a plain cloak and bound hands—just another shape the city intends to make an example of. The hood shifts as they force the figure to face the crowd.

And the face is familiar.

It’s **Lysa Corven**.

For a heartbeat the square feels like it tilts. Your memory stumbles over itself—favours traded, warnings given, names spoken in confidence, the small mercies she arranged for people no one else noticed.

Lysa’s gaze sweeps the crowd once—quick, sharp, taking inventory—then finds you.

She doesn’t look surprised.

---

## The Charges
**Read aloud:**

“In the matter of Lysa Corven—charged with conspiracy against the realm, sedition, and correspondence with agents of Iuz.”

A parchment crackles.

“By trafficking in secrets and directing citizens into treasonous hands, she endangered the city of Chendl and the lives of its people.”

The crowd gives the speaker what he wants: noise. Outrage. Relief. Fear.

Lysa says nothing.

Not yet.

---

## Lysa’s Final Words (Choose One)
### Version A — The Mission
**Read aloud:**
“I didn’t sell my city. I tried to keep it from being sold.”

Her eyes find you again—one by one, like she’s assigning tasks without speaking your names.

“If you ever trusted me—if you ever took coin from my hand or a warning from my mouth—then listen close.”

“My house. Second floor. The false back behind the old map frame. Take what’s there before they do. Don’t let them burn it.”

### Version B — The Blade in the Smile
**Read aloud:**
“They needed a monster. Congratulations—you’ve been given one.”

She smiles, but it doesn’t reach her eyes.

“You want a traitor? Look for the people who can afford to *stage* one.”

Then, quieter—almost casual:
“My house. Don’t be late.”

### Version C — The Quiet Truth
**Read aloud:**
“I’m not your enemy.”

A breath. A tremor she doesn’t let become fear.

“I’m the reason some of you are still alive.”

Her eyes find you again, steadier than this moment deserves.

“Go to my house. Please.”

## The Execution
**Read aloud (fast, inevitable):**

The rest happens with the awful efficiency of a procedure practiced too often. The crowd surges forward, then stills. The headsman does not hesitate. The platform creaks once.

And Lysa Corven is gone.

For a moment, the square is silent—not out of respect, but out of shock at how quickly a person can become a story.

Then the noise returns—louder, harsher—because the city doesn’t know what to do with grief unless it can turn it into anger.

---

## Open the Floor: “What Do You Do?”
**DM cue:**
Immediately ask: **“What do you do?”** Let them confer briefly.

### If they hesitate: Prompt Toward Lysa’s House
Use one of these:

- A shaken bystander murmurs:
  “They’ll strip her home. They always do.”
- A watch officer barks to a squad:
  “Corven residence. Seal it. Inventory. No exceptions.”
- A runner pushes through clutching a sealed note. You catch one word on it:
  **CORVEN.**
- A temple acolyte whispers:
  “Some will gather at her home… quickly, before the city decides grief is suspicious.”

**End of Quest 1 direction:**
The next scene begins on the streets—boots on wet stone—as the PCs move toward **Lysa Corven’s house** with urgency and purpose.
