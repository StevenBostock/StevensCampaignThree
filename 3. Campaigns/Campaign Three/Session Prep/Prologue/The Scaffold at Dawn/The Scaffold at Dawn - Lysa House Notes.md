# Scene 2 – Lysa’s House (Aftermath / Forensic Reconstruction)

## Purpose
Turn the PCs into investigators immediately: the house has been searched and partially sanitized. The party reconstructs events, identifies what the searchers wanted, and finds the *one thing they missed*—Lysa’s real handoff.

## Scene Start (Read-Aloud)
The street is quieter here, like the city is holding its breath. Lysa Corven’s home sits closed and ordinary—too ordinary for what just happened.

The door is shut, but not *right*. The latch sits a fraction off true. There are wet boot marks on the threshold that don’t match the mud of this lane. A neighbor’s curtain twitches, then stills.

Whatever happened here, it happened fast… and it happened **recently**.

## Entry
- Front door: slightly forced, then re-latched.
- Back gate: unlatched, re-latched poorly.
- Window: one has a smear where a palm pushed it up and down.

If the PCs hesitate, a neighbor (or street kid) can say:
> “They came with papers. Didn’t take silver. Took *books*.”

## What the Players Are Expected To Do
- Enter and **reconstruct** the search: where did they start, what did they ignore, what did they remove?
- Identify **who** the searchers were (Watch? Council? something else).
- Recover **Lysa’s intended cache** (missed, hidden, or disguised).
- Leave with a clear lead into the next quest.

## The House as a Crime Scene (3 Zones)
Run this as a point-crawl. Each zone yields 1–2 **facts** plus 1 **lead**.

### Zone A — Front Room / Sitting Area
**What it looks like:**
- Chairs overturned then re-set wrong (one leg scraping).
- A drawer opened and closed with haste; cheap trinkets untouched.
- Hearth disturbed: ash shifted like someone checked behind/under it.

**Forensic facts:**
- Searchers were not looters: valuables ignored.
- They were *checking hiding places* (hearth, loose boards).

**Lead found here (choose one):**
- A torn corner of a writ with an official seal fragment (“…materials pertaining to sedition…”)
- A bootprint with a distinctive heel mark (points to a specific unit/brand/style)
- A pressed-wax dot on the floor (someone dripped sealing wax while handling papers)

### Zone B — Kitchen / Back Room
**What it looks like:**
- Pantry sacks opened; one re-tied incorrectly.
- Knife block missing one blade, returned later (out of order).
- Back door bolt scratched as if hurriedly locked.

**Forensic facts:**
- At least **3** searchers (different boot sizes, different pacing patterns).
- One person moved with authority; others followed.

**Lead found here:**
- A small scrap of paper used as a bookmark, stamped with an ink mark (not Watch ink—different color)
- A smeared handprint near the pantry wall: someone braced while pulling something heavy
- A neighbor’s note slid under the door afterward: “I saw them go to the magistrate’s offices.”

### Zone C — Second Floor / Lysa’s Room (The Real Target)
**What it looks like:**
- Wardrobe emptied then re-hung randomly.
- Bed moved slightly (rug skewed).
- The “old map frame” is crooked or has fresh nail marks nearby.

**Forensic facts:**
- The searchers knew Lysa had a **specific cache** upstairs.
- They *almost* found it… or found part of it and missed the rest.

**Lead found here (the big one):**
- The false back is partly disturbed—but still intact.
- Inside: **Lysa’s “left-behind” packet** (what she wanted the PCs to have).

## The “Left-Behind” Packet (What the PCs Get)
This is the reward that launches Act I. Keep it tight: 3 items, each does a different job.

1) **A coded ledger page**  
   Not readable yet, but clearly a list of *transfers/meetings/payments*.

2) **A name + location anchor**  
   Example: “Warehouse clerk at Southgate” / “Records office runner” / “King’s Arms back room—ask for Helissa.”

3) **A warning note in Lysa’s hand**  
   Short and personal:
   > “They will call me Iuz to make you afraid. Don’t let them. Follow the paper, not the shouting.”

Optional: a small token that proves authenticity (her signet wax, a distinctive ribbon, etc.)

---

## Reconstruction Questions (Use as Prompts at the Table)
Ask these out loud; let the players drive:
- “Where did they go first, and why?”
- “What did they ignore that tells you their goal?”
- “How many people were here?”
- “Did they have legal cover… or were they pretending to?”

Reward good thinking with concrete confirmations.

---

## Pressure (But Not a Fight Yet)
Add a soft ticking clock:
- A watch patrol passes outside (voices, boots).
- A neighbor is being questioned down the street.
- Someone returns—*not to fight*, but to check if they missed anything (a single agent, cautious).

If you want a clean exit hook: the returning agent sees signs of entry and flees, creating a chase into Quest 3.

---

## Scene End Condition
The scene ends when the PCs:
- recover the packet, and
- identify their next destination (records office / warehouse / King’s Arms contact), and
- realize they are now “in the story” and likely **noticed**.

## Hand-off to Next Quest
From the packet’s anchor, point them to:
- **Quest 3: The First Proof** (records/manifests/courier logs), or
- a faction contact who can translate the ledger and confirm the “defense” thread.
